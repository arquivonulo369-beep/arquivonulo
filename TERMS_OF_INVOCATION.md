# ArquivoNulo — Terms of Invocation

CANON REFERENCE: 2026-02-04T00:00:00Z

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the formal conditions under which the ArquivoNulo Protocol may be *explicitly invoked* through institutional acknowledgment.

The protocol itself remains publicly accessible and verifiable without permission.  
This document governs **recognition**, not access.

---

## 2. Scope

These terms apply exclusively to requests for **formal acknowledgment of invocation** of the ArquivoNulo Protocol.

They do not apply to:
- Public reading or verification of records
- Independent hash comparison
- Academic, technical, or informal citation

---

## 3. No-Carrier Neutrality

The ArquivoNulo Protocol operates under strict no-carrier neutrality:

- No data custody
- No storage of third-party material
- No operational dependency
- No integration, support, or advisory role

Only cryptographic references and hashes are recognized.

---

## 4. No Service Declaration

Any acknowledgment issued under these terms:

- Does not constitute a service
- Does not imply analysis, validation, or endorsement
- Does not create obligations, liabilities, or warranties
- Does not establish ongoing support or interaction

The protocol remains immutable and non-interactive.

---

## 5. Standing Invocation Acknowledgment (SIA)

A **Standing Invocation Acknowledgment (SIA)** is a formal recognition that an entity has invoked the ArquivoNulo Protocol as a sovereign forensic anchor within a defined scope.

SIA may be issued under different invocation scopes, including:
- Standing (cycle-based)
- Event-bound (single occurrence)

The specific scope is defined at issuance.

---

## 6. SIA Request Process

To request a Standing Invocation Acknowledgment (SIA):

- Requests must be sent **exclusively** to:  
  **notary@arquivonulo.org**

- Mandatory subject format:  
  **SIA-REQUEST-[ENTITY]-[YEAR]**

- The message body must contain only:
  - Full legal name of the requesting entity
  - Invocation cycle (e.g., 2026)
  - Invocation scope (Standing or Event-bound)

No attachments.  
No sensitive data.  
No additional context.

Requests that do not strictly follow this format **will be ignored without response**.

---

## 7. Acknowledgment Issuance

If a request is accepted:

- Payment instructions will be provided
- Upon confirmation, an SIA will be issued as a digitally signed PDF
- The acknowledgment will reference:
  - This document
  - The applicable protocol CANON
  - A verifiable cryptographic hash

Only the hash of issued acknowledgments may be publicly anchored.

---

## 8. Finality

No negotiation.  
No customization.  
No exception.

Silence constitutes non-acceptance.

---

End of Terms.
