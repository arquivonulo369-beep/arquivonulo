# STRUCTURAL_AUTHORITY_MODEL_2026

Status: Active  
Layer: Institutional Architecture  
Revision Policy: Versioned + Traceable

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE

Authority does not originate from audience size, narrative control, or distribution scale.

Authority emerges from:

- Structural persistence
- Cryptographic anchoring
- Append-only mutation control
- Cross-layer traceability

---

## 2. LAYER MODEL

### Layer 0 — Emission
Raw artifacts, documents, residues.

### Layer 1 — Canonical Declaration
State documents (CANON-STATE-*).

### Layer 2 — Cryptographic Anchoring
Hash sidecars (SHA-256 legacy, SHA3-384 forward).

### Layer 3 — Structural Freeze
Automated tag-based snapshot:
- Index file
- Hash file
- Ledger entry

### Layer 4 — Institutional Ledger
STRUCTURAL_LEDGER.md (append-only).

### Layer 5 — Aggregated Traceability
REGISTRY_INDEX.md (macro view).

## 3. SCARCITY MODEL

Scarcity is generated by:

- Temporal locking (tags)
- Cryptographic integrity
- Irreversibility of ledger entries
- Controlled mutation policy

No artificial supply constraints.
No marketing-driven limitation.

Scarcity emerges from structural cost of replication.

---

## 4. MONETIZATION INTERFACE

Monetization, when present:

- Is external to the authority layer
- References frozen states
- Cannot modify canonical records
- Must trace back to a ledger entry

Authority precedes monetization.

---

## 5. GOVERNANCE MODEL

- Append-only institutional memory
- No destructive edits
- Supersession preferred over deletion
- Cryptographic forward-only transitions

---

## 6. SYSTEM CHARACTER

This is a NO_CARRIER structure.

It does not optimize for persuasion.
It optimizes for persistence.

Time validates.
Structure preserves.
Ledger records.
