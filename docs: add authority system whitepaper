# ArquivoNulo — Global Authority Funnel

## Abstract

ArquivoNulo operates as a Global Authority Registry for residual systems.
It does not function as a platform, product, or community.
It functions as an infrastructural funnel where authority emerges from indexation, persistence, and temporal verification.

This document defines the structural mechanics of the ArquivoNulo system.

---

## System Model

ArquivoNulo is a non-interactive, non-narrative authority system.
It does not optimize for reach, engagement, or comprehension.

Authority is not claimed.
Authority emerges.

---

## Funnel Architecture

The system operates through a layered funnel of decreasing entropy:

### Layer 1 — Emission
Public signals are emitted without optimization or audience targeting.

### Layer 2 — Indexation
Search engines and public platforms index the signal passively.

### Layer 3 — Temporal Anchoring
External archival systems (e.g. Internet Archive) lock the state in time.

### Layer 4 — Authority Registry (GitHub)
This repository validates the existence and continuity of the record.
GitHub is not storage.
GitHub is authority.

### Layer 5 — Selective Access
Optional layers may instantiate ownership, access, or monetization.
These layers do not affect authority.

---

## Role of GitHub

GitHub functions as the root authority layer.
No record is considered valid unless registered here.

Deletion is avoided.
Supersession is preferred.
Continuity outweighs clarity.

---

## Operational Properties

- No onboarding
- No explanation layers
- No persuasion mechanisms
- No interaction requirement

The system does not respond.
It persists.

---

## Final Statement

ArquivoNulo is not validated by consensus.
It is validated by time.

This repository exists so that time — not interpretation — determines relevance.
