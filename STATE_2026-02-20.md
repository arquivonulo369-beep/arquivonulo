# ARQUIVONULO — STATE FREEZE
## 2026-02-20

Status: CANONICAL STATE
Model: Forward Continuity
Hash Standard: SHA3-384

---

## 1. Context

On 2026-02-20 the repository reached a structural and cryptographic alignment milestone.

This state formalizes:

- Institutional README evolution
- Adoption of SHA3-384 as canonical hash standard
- Forward-only governance continuity model
- Cryptographic sidecar validation (.sha3-384 files)

---

## 2. Canonical Commits

Structural Evolution Commit:
ac2a069  
"README: institutional evolution state (forward continuity model)"

Cryptographic Seal Commit:
596d936  
"README: update SHA3-384 canonical hash (state 2026-02-20)"

## 3. Canonical Hash

README.md SHA3-384:

3cf88d81da9cfecb75366c996df34b5d215843380b7f4e71102769d9584be9020870504b08b72268a2db74dd792dae12

Verification command:

openssl dgst -sha3-384 README.md

---

## 4. Governance Model

This repository now operates under:

- Non-destructive evolution
- Hash-backed integrity validation
- Transparent forward continuity
- No retroactive rewriting of canonical state

All future structural modifications must:
1. Be committed.
2. Generate corresponding SHA3-384 sidecar.
3. Be cryptographically sealable.

---

## 5. Integrity Declaration

This file freezes the institutional state of the repository as of:

2026-02-20

Any future change must reference this state as historical baseline.
