# LEGAL_FRAMEWORK_TIER3_VOUCHER.md

## Purpose
This document defines the legal and technical framing of the **Tier 3 Voucher** as a right to access a sealed, pre-existing compliance artifact.

## Artifact Description
The Tier 3 Voucher grants access to a fixed, immutable set of cryptographically sealed records intended for high-assurance audit and governance scenarios.

No customization, modification, or operational support is included.

## Regulatory Alignment
Use of the artifact accessed via this voucher supports:

- **EU AI Act – Articles 9 and 10:**  
  Provides independent, third-party reference evidence for risk management and data governance documentation.

- **ISO/IEC 22989:2022 – Clause 5.2:**  
  Serves as an external governance and lifecycle reference.

- **Enterprise Audit Requirements:**  
  Enables segregation of duties by introducing a non-internal evidentiary source.

## Legal Characterization
- Voucher represents access, not a service  
- No ongoing obligations after delivery  
- No system integration required  
- Compatible with procurement and audit workflows

## Verification
Verification procedures are identical to other ArquivoNulo artifacts and are fully documented in `HOW_TO_VERIFY.md`.

## Liability Boundary

No operational guarantees, regulatory approvals, or fitness-for-purpose claims are made.
