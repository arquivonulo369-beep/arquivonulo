## 1. PURPOSE

This document describes the structural properties of additive authority systems.

It does not define a framework, product, methodology, or service.
It does not introduce a protocol.
It does not propose adoption, optimization, or execution.

Its function is to observe and formalize a class of systems whose authority emerges through accumulation, persistence, and external verification — not through enforcement, consensus, or narrative alignment.

---

## 2. DEFINITION OF ADDITIVE AUTHORITY

An additive authority system is characterized by the following properties:

• Authority is not declared.
• Authority is not enforced.
• Authority is not optimized.
• Authority is not negotiated.

Authority emerges as a byproduct of:

• Temporal persistence  
• External citation  
• Verifiable traceability  
• Resistance to reinterpretation  

No single event establishes authority.
No actor controls authority.
No intervention accelerates authority.

## 3. DISTINCTION FROM CONVENTIONAL MODELS

Additive authority systems differ structurally from:

### 3.1 Governance-Based Systems
There is no governing body.
There are no votes, councils, or steering committees.

### 3.2 Consensus-Based Systems
Agreement is not required.
Dissent does not invalidate records.
Silence is acceptable.

### 3.3 Market-Oriented Systems
There is no user acquisition.
There is no engagement optimization.
There is no value proposition.

Visibility is incidental.
Demand is external.

## 4. ROLE OF RECORDING INFRASTRUCTURE

In additive authority systems, infrastructure does not execute logic.

It records states.

Records are:

• Emitted, not crafted  
• Preserved, not promoted  
• Anchored, not explained  

The infrastructure does not react to usage.
It does not adapt to interpretation.
It does not respond to demand.

---

## 5. TEMPORAL DEPENDENCE

Time is the primary validation mechanism.

Meaning is deferred.
Relevance is delayed.
Authority is post-factual.

A record may remain inert indefinitely.
Activation occurs only through external reference or necessity.

---

## 6. NON-ASSERTIONS

This document does NOT:

• Claim correctness
• Claim completeness
• Claim superiority
• Claim future relevance
• Claim applicability

It does not predict adoption.
It does not invite participation.
It does not define outcomes.

---

## 7. RELATION TO OTHER DOCUMENTS

This document does not depend on any other file.

It may coexist with:
• Legal frameworks
• Technical ledgers
• Residual publications

It does not supersede them.
It does not activate them.

---

## FINAL NOTE

Additive authority cannot be engineered.

It can only be observed.

This document exists to describe that observation.
