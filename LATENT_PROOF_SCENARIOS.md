# LATENT_PROOF_SCENARIOS

This document enumerates latent, non-prescriptive scenarios in which the
ArquivoNulo oracle may be referenced as a temporal integrity anchor.

This file is descriptive only.
It does not constitute an offer, service description, certification,
endorsement, or obligation of response.

All scenarios described herein are hypothetical and inert until independently
invoked under the TERMS_OF_INVOCATION.

Append-only. No retroactive modification.

---

## Scenario 001 — Arbitration & Infrastructure Disputes

A procedural manual, safety protocol, or decision framework is anchored
prior to execution. In case of dispute, the hash demonstrates that the
document existed in a defined state before the event.

No validation of correctness is implied.

---

## Scenario 002 — M&A and Corporate Governance

Board-level assumptions, risk frameworks, or intent declarations are
anchored prior to negotiations. The oracle provides proof of anteriority
against post-facto reinterpretation.

---

## Scenario 003 — Scientific Hypothesis Anchoring

A hypothesis or experimental design is sealed prior to data collection.
The oracle establishes epistemic anteriority without validating results.

---

## Scenario 004 — Cultural or Artistic Manifesto

A conceptual work or manifesto is anchored to resist censorship,
revisionism, or erasure. The oracle preserves temporal existence only.

End of latent scenarios.
