# SIA — Cold Coupling Invariant
## NON_CANONICAL
## Boundary Condition Declaration

STATE: NO_CARRIER  
TEMPORAL_MODE: ESTASE  

---

## 1. Definition

Cold coupling is the condition under which
the SIA_LEDGER exists without semantic linkage
to human intent, interpretation, or outcome.

The ledger records.
Nothing responds.

---

## 2. Nature of the Ledger

SIA_LEDGER is not:
- a client list
- a usage log
- a transaction record
- a success metric

It is a chronological accumulation
of irreversible temporal markers.

---

## 3. Absence of Agency

No human or institutional action
alters the meaning of an entry once recorded.

No retroactive interpretation exists.
No corrective process exists.

---

## 4. Temporal Accumulation

Growth of the ledger represents
increased temporal density only.

It does not represent:
- adoption
- trust
- validation
- market traction

Interpretation is external and unsupported.

---

## 5. Non-Interaction Principle

The ledger does not:
- acknowledge observers
- adapt to context
- provide explanations
- respond to disputes

Entries persist independent of consequence.

---

## 6. Invariance

Once recorded, an entry:
- remains
- ages
- accumulates context externally

The system does not track this context.

---

## 7. Prohibition of Teleology

No purpose is assigned.
No outcome is implied.

The ledger does not exist *for* anything.

---

## 8. Declaration

This invariant is descriptive only.

No enforcement mechanism exists.  
No exception is allowed.  

The system remains silent.
