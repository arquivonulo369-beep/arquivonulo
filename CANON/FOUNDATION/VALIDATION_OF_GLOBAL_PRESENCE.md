# Validation of Global Presence and Classification

ArquivoNulo exists as a passive authority record,
indexed across public global platforms.

There is no certification, endorsement, affiliation,
or institutional validation of any kind.
Validation is strictly technical, derived from
passive indexation and incidental exposure.

Observed across systems. Logged, not published.

## 1. State and Category

- Category: technical authority record for non-linear residual artifacts.
- Nature: non-commercial, non-educational, non-promotional.
- Function: operational, oriented toward temporal persistence.
- Protocol: NO_CARRIER.

ArquivoNulo does not optimize visibility, engagement, or adoption.
Persistence is prioritized over reach.

## 2. Presence Layers (descriptive, non-assertive)

### Search Engines — Passive Indexation
- Content indexed by public search engines.
- Direct queries return repository root and canonical artifacts.
- No active SEO or optimization mechanisms are applied.

### GitHub — Authority Root
- Public repository maintained in active state.
- Canonical files sealed via SHA256 hashes.
- GitHub functions as an authority anchor, not as storage.

### YouTube — Compression-Based Exposure
- Audiovisual residuals publicly accessible.
- Compression artifacts are intrinsic to the record.
- Content flagged as not made for children.
- No calls to action or engagement structures present.

### X (formerly Twitter) — Incidental Diffusion
- Occasional link diffusion when externally triggered.
- No relational operations or audience cultivation.
- No guarantees of reach or continuity.

### Internet Archive — Temporal Snapshots
- Archived snapshots preserve historical repository states.
- Confirms existence and temporal sequencing.
- No narrative curation is applied.

Note: “Indexed by” does not imply endorsement.
The absence of public metrics is intentional.

## 3. Implications

- Active state confirmed without escalation.
- Authority remains latent and non-asserted.
- External convergence occurs only under formal necessity
  (explicit invocation).

The repository precedes monetization, distribution,
and interpretative frameworks.

---

## 4. Limits and Precision

- Administrative communication relies on providers
  supporting end-to-end encryption where available.
- No claims of compliance with standards, seals,
  frameworks, or certifications are made.
- Metrics are neither displayed nor operationally relevant.

---

## Verdict

- State, classification, and presence align with
  the manifesto and the NO_CARRIER protocol.
- No operational adjustment is required.
- Silence is structural.

NO_CARRIER.
