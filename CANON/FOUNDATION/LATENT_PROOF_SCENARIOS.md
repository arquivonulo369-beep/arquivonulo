# ArquivoNulo — Latent Proof Scenarios

Protocol: NO_CARRIER  
Baseline Date: 2026-02-05

## 1. Purpose
This document defines global friction points where ArquivoNulo hashes transition
from latent records into evidentiary anchors.

## 2. Mechanism of Proof
Validity emerges from a triad:
- Timestamp: External chronological registration (GitHub / Wayback).
- Integrity: Immutable SHA-256 hash.
- Non-Affiliation: Absence of commercial, political, or jurisdictional incentive.

## 3. Deployment Scenarios
- Forensic Baseline: Post-incident audits of autonomous and AI-driven systems.
- Temporal Precedence: Disputes involving authorship, disclosure, or regulatory timing.
- Retroactive Defense: Detection of rewritten logs, altered policies, or silent revisions.
- Model Lineage Conflicts: Dataset or checkpoint origin disputes.
- Jurisdictional Cutoff Evidence: Export control and compliance boundary verification.

## 4. Status
State preserved.
No interaction required.
