# arquivonulo

This repository is not a product, library, or framework.

It is a persistence layer for technical residues:
logs, fragments, and artifacts generated by non-linear systems
operating beyond direct interaction.

Files are not curated for usability.
They are emitted, observed, and archived.

Interpretation is optional.
Propagation is incidental.
