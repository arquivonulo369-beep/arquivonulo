# NATURE

This repository is not a product, framework, library, or community.
It is a **global authority registry**.

ArquivoNulo exists to:

* Record technical residues
* Validate deterministic states
* Preserve cryptographic continuity
* Anchor temporal integrity

Nothing here is optimized for usability.
Nothing here is designed for onboarding.
Nothing here asks for attention.

Files are emitted, not crafted.
States are observed, not explained.
Records are preserved, not promoted.

Persistence is structural.

---

# CORE FUNCTION

This repository functions as the canonical validation layer of ArquivoNulo.

It exists to:

• Confirm externally indexed signals
• Anchor records to verifiable temporal states
• Preserve cross-platform traceability
• Prevent reinterpretation drift
• Maintain forward cryptographic continuity

If a record does not exist here,
it does not exist as a validated technical reference.

GitHub is not used as storage.
It is used as a public anteriority anchor.

---

# TECHNICAL SCOPE

This repository may contain:

• Preemptive signal registrations (RESG / REG)
• Residual artifacts
• Entropy logs
• Non-linear traces
• Validation documents
• Cryptographically sealed ledger states
• Signed Merkle root snapshots

Completeness is not guaranteed.
Continuity is not promised.
Clarity is not a goal.

Integrity is.

# MERKLE SNAPSHOT AUTHORITY LAYER

(Operational 2026-02-26)

Ledger states may be sealed via:

• Deterministic Merkle root (SHA3-384)
• Ed25519 signature
• Public key fingerprint anchoring
• Previous-root chaining
• Ledger file hash anchoring

**Ledger:**

```
logs/query_guard.jsonl
```

**Snapshot Builder:**

```
engine/merkle.py
```

**Validation:**

```
validate_snapshot.py
```

**Auditor:**

```
audit_ledger.py
```

**Snapshots Directory:**

```
snapshots/snapshot_*.json
```

Each snapshot includes:

• merkle_root
• tree_size
• timestamp
• previous_root
• pubkey_fingerprint
• ledger_file_hash

Authority derives from verifiable continuity.

# BUSINESS PROCESSES UPDATE (2026-02-26/27)

Structural Integrity as a Service (SIaaS) — Operational Layer

Residual Processes Emitted:

• Algorithmic Integrity Assurance (AIA)
• Ponto Zero de Processamento
• Immutable Evidence Chain (RFC 8785 canonical JSON + Ed25519 + SHA3-384 chaining)
• FinOps Neutralization Layer
• Web2 → Web3 Composability Bridge

Processes are emitted as residuals.
Verification available via independent audit.

---

# CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARD — FORWARD TRANSITION

(Effective 2026-02-20)

Artifacts created before 2026-02-20
→ SHA-256 (Legacy Baseline)

Artifacts created on or after 2026-02-20
→ SHA3-384 (Forward Canonical Standard)

Legacy artifacts remain immutable.
No retroactive modification occurs.

**Hash sidecar format:**

```
filename.ext.sha256
filename.ext.sha3-384
```

Hashes generated via `hashlib` and independently verifiable.

# INTEGRITY MODEL

ArquivoNulo operates under a forward-only governance structure.

• Evolution is documented
• History is preserved
• Cryptographic lineage is traceable
• No retroactive alteration

Authority depends on continuity, not revision.

# VALIDATED EXTERNAL RESIDUES

# POSITION WITHIN THE EXTERNAL AUTHORITY SYSTEM

Validation Flow:

Search indexing confirms existence
Public residues expose traces
Temporal markers lock states
This repository validates records
Snapshots seal states cryptographically

No asset, derivative, or dataset is authoritative
unless validated here first.

GitHub is not a mirror.
It is the root validation layer.

---

# VERSIONING PRINCIPLE

This README is an institutional document.

Each structural revision:

• Is committed
• Is traceable via Git history
• May be cryptographically sealed
• May be externally archived

Authority depends on traceable continuity.

---

# FINAL STATEMENT

ArquivoNulo does not seek users.
It records states.

Meaning is not assigned.
Authority is not claimed.

Both emerge over time
through consistency, persistence, and traceability.

This repository exists so that
time — not interpretation — decides relevance.
