# RESG_016 — Confluence Without Carrier

TYPE: RESG (Global Environmental Residue)
MODE: NO_CARRIER
REFERENCE: RESG-004
STATE: CONFLUENCE
STATUS: ACTIVE / OBSERVED

---

## STATE DESCRIPTION

RESG_016 documents a state of confluence where multiple flows coexist without origin hierarchy.

Sea, rivers, and falls occupy the same operational surface.
There is no upstream or downstream — only presence.

Under NO_CARRIER conditions, the signal is not distributed.
It is encountered.

The organism disengages from primary transport mechanisms and becomes responsive to the external environment as indexable, not recommendable.

The system does not call.
It remains.

Whoever finds it is already inside.

---

## VALIDATION

- External indexation observed.
- No internal distribution signals detected.
- Codec stress consistent with surface overlap.
- Interaction requirement: null.
