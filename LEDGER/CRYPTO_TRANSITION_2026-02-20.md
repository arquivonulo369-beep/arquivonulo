# ARQUIVONULO GLOBAL
## CRYPTOGRAPHIC TRANSITION DECLARATION
Date: 2026-02-20
Status: Canonical Governance Event

---

## 1. Background

Since its initial structuring, the ArquivoNulo system utilized SHA-256 as its baseline cryptographic integrity mechanism.

As of 2026-02-20, the system formally adopts SHA3-384 as its canonical hashing algorithm.

This transition represents structural evolution, not corrective revision.

---

## 2. Specification

### Legacy Baseline
Algorithm: SHA-256  
Scope: Artifacts created prior to 2026-02-20  

### Canonical Standard
Algorithm: SHA3-384  
Scope: All canonical artifacts from 2026-02-20 onward  

---

## 3. Immutability Clause

All historical artifacts hashed under SHA-256 remain valid and unaltered.

No retroactive re-hashing shall occur.

The preservation of algorithmic lineage is a requirement for systemic traceability.

---

## 4. Governance Principle

Integrity in ArquivoNulo Global is forward-only.

Evolution is documented.
History is preserved.
Traceability is absolute.
