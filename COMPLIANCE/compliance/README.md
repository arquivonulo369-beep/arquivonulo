# Compliance Artifacts

This directory contains legal and regulatory framing documents
associated with passive technical artifacts validated by ArquivoNulo.

These documents:
- are descriptive, not executable
- do not grant access to data or systems
- exist to support legal, compliance, and procurement review
- do not alter the authority state of the repository

No artifact is a product by itself.
Products are instantiated externally and may reference these documents.
