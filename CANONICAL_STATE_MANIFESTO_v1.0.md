## 1. Declaration of Structural Intent

ArquivoNulo Global is a canonical state architecture designed to establish verifiable structural authority in digital environments.

It operates through:

- Canonical freezing mechanisms
- Cryptographic hash validation
- Structural ledger indexing
- Institutional layering
- Residual trace preservation

The objective is not publication.  
The objective is structural permanence.

## 2. Architectural Layers

The repository is organized into the following constitutional layers:

### CANON
Immutable state declarations and frozen historical structures.

### AUTHORITY
Formal authority models and structural governance definitions.

### LEDGER
Index records, structural logs, and test registries.

### PROTOCOLS
Technical standards, verification procedures, and system specifications.

### COMPLIANCE
Legal, immutability, and institutional validation frameworks.

### PUBLICATIONS
Editorial materials, whitepapers, and formal releases.

### INTERNAL
Institutional strategy and business architecture layers.

### RESIDUALS
Preserved structural remnants and historical fragments.

## 3. Structural Principles

1. No silent modification of canonical state.
2. Every structural claim must be hash-verifiable.
3. Authority is declared through architecture, not rhetoric.
4. Historical layers are preserved, not overwritten.
5. Institutional coherence supersedes cosmetic organization.

---

## 4. Authority Model

ArquivoNulo Global does not claim institutional legitimacy through external endorsement.

It establishes structural legitimacy through:

- State freezing
- Hash integrity
- Layer separation
- Transparent versioning
- Public repository traceability

---

## 5. Canonical Commitment

This document establishes the constitutional baseline for the ArquivoNulo Global repository from version 1.0 forward.

Any future structural reorganization must:

- Preserve canonical layers
- Maintain verification integrity
- Declare version transitions explicitly
